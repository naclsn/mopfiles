## teach-y ones

    grep
        use the complete form g/re/p
    ...
        combine g/re/y with upper-case register
    hex editor
        xxd, edit, xxd-r
    -q
        start with -q
    stuck in vim, ladida, st%u
        quit w/o using an ex command or mapping
    dry
        no 2 same normal commands in a row for [n]

## difficult/useless ones

    I'm only a normal dev
        [edit session] using only normal (and operator pending)
        ie no visual/insert/replace/command
    I'm only an ex-dev
        [edit session] in ex mode only
    where was I?
        -S a 1 month old session
    we need to go further beyond
        2 or more recursion level complex-repeat
    spell it out
        [edit session] fully spelling out [n] ex commands
        could be restricted to a annoying set like :substitute, :global, :print
        and/or extended to requiring the last / or ?, :set options and more
        could be for a given set of things that are usually shortened, must do 1 of each, count them
    ...
        100 buffers at once doesn't seem like a lot..
    :hi!
        :hi!
    in control
        [n] CTRL-. different in a row
